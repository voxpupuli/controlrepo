# Puppet Code to manage [voxpupu.li](https://voxpupu.li)

[Hetzner cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) sponsors us a cloud instance.
It's currently running Ubuntu 18.04. This repository works as a control
repository for [r10k](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k#r10k).

The main purpose of this cloud instance is to run [Vox Pupuli Tasks](https://github.com/voxpupuli/vox-pupuli-tasks#vox-pupuli-tasks---the-webapp-for-community-management).
